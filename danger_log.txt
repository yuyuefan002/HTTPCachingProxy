1. Avoiding using exit() or _exit() to quit the subprocess created by fork(), since recourses cannot be realeased by this two method.
2. could we narrow the waiting interval of recv in client.cpp, 1s might be too long.

warning: pass unit test only means it behaves right when using it right.

1. real all text from a file should use getline until eof
2. getline is not a good idea, it will ruin the format, sstream is better
3. proxy is slow
4. cannot save root directory, if it is not a recourse name, we should store them in index.html.
5. string will omit any content after \0, data encoding is common in http, therefore, we should user char pointer to handle our http response;

2/19
1.important:need to change cache implementation
2.LRU eviction strategy
3.look up the diff between GET POST and CONNECT
4.we should use connect timeout to end recv data from server, or it will be even slower
5.when we use post, server will disconnect once?
6.each post will happen after connect

2/20
1.parser could go wrong, string cannot equal null. should use exception to handle these situation
2.very hard to debug why connect failed,now I know all my function is correct.

2/24
1.in tunnel mode, need request id to log.
2.reasons of not cacheable is not necessarily "private", "no-cache", or "no-store". could also be max-age is 0.
