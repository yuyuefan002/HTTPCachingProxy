1. Avoiding using exit() or _exit() to quit the subprocess created by fork(), since recourses cannot be realeased by this two method.
2. could we narrow the waiting interval of recv in client.cpp, 1s might be too long.

warning: pass unit test only means it behaves right when using it right.

1. real all text from a file should use getline until eof
2. getline is not a good idea, it will ruin the format, sstream is better
3. proxy is slow
4. cannot save root directory
